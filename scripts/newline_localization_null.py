"""Null-model probability for the Figure-13 localization claim (Exp analysis item).

The paper's localization claim (main.tex, tab:cells / sec:sweep) is that across
all seven cells the steering spike lands within the last two prompt positions --
six cells exactly at the final token, the seventh (Qwen3-0.6B, 20K, -ation) one
position earlier. This script attaches an exact null-model probability to that
claim: under the null that each cell's spike position is uniform over its n_i
swept positions, and cells are independent,

    p_last_two = prod_i (2 / n_i)                    (the "last two positions" event)
    p_all_final = prod_i (1 / n_i)                   (strict: every cell at final token)

and, because the observed pattern is 6-of-7 exactly at the final token, the
appendix "6-of-7" number is the probability of at least six cells landing on the
final token under per-cell success rate p_i = 1 / n_i (an exact Poisson-binomial,
with a mean-rate simple-binomial reported alongside as a sanity check).

n_i is read from each cell's committed grid JSON as ``len(sweep)`` -- it is the
token/position count of the cell's prompt and is therefore invariant to steering
strength and grid version. The authoritative grid per cell is the one at that
cell's Table-2 "Best s"; the mapping below is transcribed from tab:cells and the
spike position each grid reports is asserted to match the paper's stated pattern.
